# doom-config

Some configuration for Doom Emacs that is intended as a base-config for all my devices.  
It should work on top of a default emacs configuration.

### Usage

Clone the repo inside '~/doom.d' and add this line inside your 'config.el':

``` emacs-lisp
(load "~/.doom.d/doom-config/general.el")
```
